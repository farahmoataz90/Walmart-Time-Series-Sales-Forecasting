## Project Overview
This project is a Business Intelligence analysis of Walmart sales data. The goal is to help Walmart understand which products, regions, categories, and customer segments they should target or avoid. The analysis includes data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and machine learning modeling to provide actionable insights.

## Dataset Description
The Walmart dataset consists of 21 columns and 9,995 rows, with the following features:

## Project Objectives
1. Understand the dataset and define project objectives.
2. Perform data exploration using summary statistics and visualization methods.
3. Clean and transform the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates, handle outliers).
4. Visualize the dataset using PowerBI.
5. Develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict sales.
6. Create a time series analysis for Walmart sales.

## Methods and Techniques
### Data Exploration
- Summary statistics to understand data distribution and key metrics.
- Visualization methods such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Identifying and managing outliers.

### Visualization
- PowerBI dashboards to visualize sales data across different dimensions.

### Machine Learning
- Development of a predictive model for sales using techniques like linear regression, decision trees, or more advanced methods as appropriate.

### Time Series Analysis
- Creating and analyzing a time series for Walmart sales based on Order Date and Sales columns.

## Results
- Identified product categories with the highest sales.
- Determined customer segments contributing most to sales.
- Analyzed regional, state, and city-level contributions to sales and profit.
- Examined interactions between different factors affecting sales.

## Conclusion
The project provides Walmart owners with detailed insights into their sales data, helping them make informed decisions about product targeting, regional focus, and customer segmentation. The use of machine learning models and time series analysis offers predictive capabilities for future sales trends.
